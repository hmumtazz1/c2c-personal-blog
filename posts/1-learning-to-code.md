# My Journey: Learning to Code as a Clinician

As a clinician, I always wanted to understand how technology could improve patient care. Learning to code opened up new ways for me to solve problems and automate tasks in my daily workflow.

## The Beginning

My journey started with curiosity. I noticed how much time I spent on repetitive tasks and wondered if there was a better way. I began exploring simple scripts to automate data entry and soon realized the power of programming.

## Facing Challenges

The biggest challenge was finding time. Between patient appointments and paperwork, it felt impossible to learn something new. But I set aside just 15 minutes a day, often during lunch breaks or after work. Progress was slow, but steady.

I also struggled with the technical jargon. Terms like 'asynchronous', 'API', and 'callback' were intimidating. I joined online forums and found a community of clinicians who were also learning to code. We shared resources, tips, and encouragement.

## Breakthrough Moments

The first time I automated a report that used to take me hours, I felt empowered. I started building small tools for my team, like a medication calculator and a patient follow-up tracker. These projects not only saved time but also improved patient care.

## Advice for Clinicians

- Start small and be patient with yourself.
- Focus on problems you care about—this keeps you motivated.
- Don’t be afraid to ask for help. The coding community is welcoming!
- Celebrate every milestone, no matter how minor.

Learning to code has made me a better clinician and problem-solver. If you’re considering it, take the leap—you won’t regret it!
